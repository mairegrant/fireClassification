Arson Pattern Recognition 
Fire forensics 
An attempt at an image classification model to determine patterns such as burn patterns in fire scene photos that may indicate if a fire was arson or accidental
My first attempt at setting up an image classification model. 
Data set is attached and quite small at 157 images. 
Images have been classified if they have been either suspected OR confirmed to be accidental or arson as it was hard to find uniformity among images. 

Pattern recognition in this niche exists for purposes such as identifying flames or smoke in video footage for fire detection. 
Differences in fire patterns may occur in that there are multiple origin points, unusual spread.
